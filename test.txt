The term dialect has different meanings in different regions. In the Chinese concept, it refers to the language of a certain region that is different from the standard language, without considering the kinship relationship between languages. Dialect the Dialect in the population of Europe is a linguistic concept, refers to the beginning of the eighteenth century is generally called "language" language in the level of "Dialect", it is based on the relationship between the language (pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar) divided into family, group, branch and language. Which is located in the language is a Dialect the Dialect. However, An English translation of "Chinese dialect" is "spelt of Chinese."
According to the European understanding, a language that differs from the standard language and is only spoken in one region is a dialect.
Population migration leads to geographic isolation, which in turn leads to the differentiation of specific dialects. With the passage of time, the gap between dialects gradually increases, and the internal characteristics of dialects gradually become obvious, so it is possible to produce new languages.
The concept of dialect in this paper is based on the concept of dialect in the language pedigree standard proposed by the European school of language comparison. In other words, in imitation of biology, it is assumed that several languages evolved from specific ancestral languages. According to the kinship relationship of each language, it is divided into several language families. In today's world, there are seven language families: Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Altaic, Semitic, Dravidian, Caucasian and Uralic.
Chinese belongs to Sino-Tibetan language family, which is generally divided into 13 dialects such as international language code standard, and each language can be divided into many sub-dialects. The 13 first-level Chinese dialects are: Mandarin, Jin dialect, Cantonese, Xiang dialect, Wu dialect, Hui dialect, Gan dialect, Hakka dialect, Northern Fujian dialect, Southern Fujian dialect, Eastern Fujian dialect, Central Fujian dialect and Puxian dialect . These dialects come from ancient Chinese and are more complex for Indo-European dialects. The Indo-European languages have the largest number of native speakers in the world.
Indo-European languages can be divided into Germanic, Roman, Celtic, Baltic, Slavic, Hindi, Iranian and other languages. And within each language group, there are internal divisions. The existence of dialects expands the variety of languages and becomes an important part of language diversification.
Standard language is the official language stipulated by laws or relevant policies of various governments. Compared with dialects, standard languages have prescribed pronunciation standards and diction habits, and are promoted by the government.
